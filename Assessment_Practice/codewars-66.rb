# You will be given two integers n and k and 
# your task is to remove k-digits from n and 
# return the lowest number possible, without 
# changing the order of the digits in n. 
# Return the result as a string.

# Let's take an example of solve(123056,4). We need to 
# remove 4 digits from 123056 and return the lowest 
# possible number. The best digits to remove are (1,2,3,6) 
# so that the remaining digits are '05'. 
# Therefore, solve(123056,4) = '05'.

# Note also that the order of the numbers in n does 
# not change: solve(1284569,2) = '12456', because 
# we have removed 8 and 9. 

# input: 2 ints, n and k (amt of digits to remove)
# output: str, representing lowest num possible after removing k digits
# algo:
#     - HIGH LEVEL:
#       - Find all possible numbers, with k digits removed
#       - Return lowest num as str
#     - LOW LEVEL:
#       - initialize current_num to n
#       - initialize result empty arr
#       - initialize counter to k
#       - Until counter <= 0 
#         - Loop over each digit
#           - Remove current digit, append to result arr
#      - Reassign current_num to min value in result arr
#      - Reassign result arr to empty arr
#     - Reassign counter to counter - 1
#      - Loop over min value
#       - Remove digit at index, append to
