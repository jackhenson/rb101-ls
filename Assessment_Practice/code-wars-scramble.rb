# There is a message that is circulating via public media that 
# claims a reader can easily read a message where the inner 
# letters of each words is scrambled, as long as the first and 
# last letters remain the same and the word contains all the letters.

# Another example shows that it is quite difficult to read the text 
# where all the letters are reversed rather than scrambled.

# In this kata we will make a generator that generates text in a 
# similar pattern, but instead of scrambled or reversed, ours 
# will be sorted alphabetically

# Requirement
# return a string where:

#     the first and last characters remain in original place for each word
#     characters between the first and last characters must be sorted alphabetically
#     punctuation should remain at the same place as it started, for example: shan't -> sahn't

# Assumptions

#     words are seperated by single spaces
#     only spaces separate words, special characters do not, for example: tik-tak -> tai-ktk
#     special characters do not take the position of the non special characters, for example: -dcba -> -dbca
#     for this kata puctuation is limited to 4 characters: hyphen(-), apostrophe('), comma(,) and period(.)
#     ignore capitalisation
