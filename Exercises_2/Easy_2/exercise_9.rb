# Take a look at the following code:

# name = 'Bob'
# save_name = name
# name = 'Alice'
# puts name, save_name

# What does this code print out? Think about it 
# for a moment before continuing.

# If you said that code printed

# Alice
# Bob

# you are 100% correct, and the answer should 
# come as no surprise. Now, let's look at something a bit different:

# name = 'Bob'
# save_name = name
# name.upcase!
# puts name, save_name

# What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

Because assignment in ruby just assigns a reference to a 
variable, both name and save_name refer to the same string, Bob. 
When you apply name.upcase!, which mutates name in place, the 
value that save_name references also changes. Thus, both name 
and save_name are set equal to 'BOB'.
