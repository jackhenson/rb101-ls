# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

#     what is != and where should you use it?
#     means 'not equal to', use to return boolean value

#     put ! before something, like !user_name
#     turns any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent

#     put ! after something, like words.uniq!
#     ! used after a method usually indicates a mutating method

#     put ? before something
#     ternary operator

#     put ? after something
#     when used after a method to return boolean value

#     put !! before something, like !!user_name
#     turns any object into their boolean equivalent
